Tim and Lukas attended FENS 2024 in Vienna, Austria. Lukas organized a symposium on "Neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and spatial memory across species". In this symposium, Kate Jeffery, Gily Ginosar, Dmitriy Aronov, and Lukas presented studies on neural representations of space in rats, bats, birds, and humans. Tim presented a poster featuring his work on theta-phase locking of single neurons in humans. This was a great conference with many inspiring discussions!
