Lukas gave a talk at the colloquium "Brains in Space: An Interdisciplinary Research Colloquium on Spatial Navigation", organized by Sen Cheng and his lab at Ruhr University Bochum. Lukas' talk was about allocentric and egocentric neurons in the human brain and how they might be involved in spatial navigation and spatial memory.

In this colloquium, speakers present their research in various areas of spatial navigation, including behavioral, neuroscientific, and theoretical approaches. The goal is to foster interdisciplinary discussions along the lines of the review article "A Map of Spatial Navigation for Neuroscience" (Parra-Barrero et al., 2023) that proposes a taxonomy of spatial navigation processes in mammals. The talks will cover a diverse range of topics, from the neural underpinnings of navigation to complex navigation behaviors. Attendees will gain a better understanding of how the mammalian brain represents and navigates through space, as well as learn about several cognitive processes such as learning and memory through the lens of spatial navigation.
