The Bonn Spatial Memory Lab is very happy to welcome Iris Weichert as a new lab member!

Iris recently completed her master's studies in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience in Maastricht and Oxford. In our lab, Iris will investigate single-neuron responses of spatial views during human spatial navigation and develop methods for studying macroscopic correlates of these neuronal responses using ultra-high-field fMRI.
