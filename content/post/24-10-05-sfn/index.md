Philipp and Lukas attended SfN 2024 in Chicago, USA. Lukas gave a talk on egocentrically tuned neurons in the nanosymposium "Neural Activity Underlying Higher-Order Human Behaviors: Insights From Intracranial Recordings" organized by Salman Qasim and Jie Zheng. Philipp presented a poster featuring his latest work on EEG representations related to learning and memory-guided action. This was a great experience!
