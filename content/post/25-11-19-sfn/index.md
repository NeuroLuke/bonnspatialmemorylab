Tim, Philipp, David, Laura, and Lukas attended the Human Single-Neuron Meeting 2025 in Pasadena, and SfN 2025 in San Diego. This was a fantastic experience, including many exciting discussions with the lab of Florian Mormann, with whom we shared our apartments!

Tim presented two separate posters at HSN and SfN:
- Theta-phase locking of single neurons during human spatial memory
- A dataset of human single-neuron and intracranial EEG recordings during a spatial memory task

Philipp presented at SfN, in collaboration with Bernhard Staresina:
- Individual differences in encoding efficiency are reflected in alpha/beta and spindle activity during wake and sleep

David presented at SfN and HSN:
- Single-neurons in the human parahippocampal cortex represent spatial distances

Laura presented at HSN and SfN:
- Cellular correlates of allocentric and egocentric spatial memory in humans
