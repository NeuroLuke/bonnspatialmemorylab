Lukas took part in the Ernst Struengmann Forum "Navigation Research: Mapping the Future," which took place at the Ernst Struengmann Institute in Frankfurt from December 1-6, 2024. The Forum was chaired by Nora S. Newcombe and Ken Cheng and brought together 40 researchers specialized in navigation research. Together with Philipp, Lukas wrote a background paper on the question ''Do Data from Intracranial Techniques Align (or Not) with What We Have Learned about Human Navigation from fMRI?'' that was discussed at the Forum and will be published as part of a larger book summarizing the Forum's scientific output.
