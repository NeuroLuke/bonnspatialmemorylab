Lukas took part in the first Synergy Forum at the "IMPULSE - House for Intellectual Innovation and Creativity" of the University of Bonn and gave a presentation on his work using human single-unit recordings. This Synergy Forum was a networking event designed to bring together researchers from across faculties and spark unexpected, interdisciplinary collaborations. Many thanks to the organizers, Nicola Diny, Niels Lemmermann, and Stefanie Poll!
